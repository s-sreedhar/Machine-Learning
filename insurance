 Insurance Premium Prediction Dataset
 This dataset (insure.csv) contains features associated with potential insurance customers and the corresponding premiums they are predicted to pay. It can be used for various purposes, including:

Training and evaluating machine learning models: This dataset is ideal for building and testing models to predict insurance premiums based on different factors affecting risk.
Gaining insights into insurance pricing: Analyzing the data can reveal relationships between customer characteristics and premium amounts, aiding in understanding insurance company pricing strategies.
Benchmarking performance: Using your own model predictions on this dataset allows for comparison with the ground truth and helps assess your model's effectiveness.

# Load the dataset

# Explore the data
print(data.head())

# Assuming 'age' and 'premium' are columns in your dataset
X = data[['Age']]  # Features (independent variables)
y = data['Premium']  # Target variable (dependent variable)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Plotting for visualization (optional)

plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='blue', linewidth=3)
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Premium')
